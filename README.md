# Coffee Shop Website Project

This project was for my university web design course. I was tasked with designing a basic website for a coffee shop using HTML and CSS.


## Overview

Hello everyone,

This repository contains the code for a coffee shop website that I built as a project for my university web development course. The goal was to create a responsive and visually appealing website for a fictional coffee shop using HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for markup
- CSS for styling

## Features

- Navigation bar with links to home, menu, and order pages
- Hero section on home page with the shop logo and description
- Menu page listing hot drinks and cold 
- Basic footer with contact and location info

## Design Process

I have completed the following tasks:

1. Created a new HTML file and set up the basic structure of the website using semantic HTML elements.
2. Designed a basic layout using CSS, including a header, navigation bar, and main content section.
3. Added some basic styling to the website, including colors, fonts, and padding.


## Lessons Learned


Through this project, I learned how to plan and build a multi-page website using HTML and CSS from scratch. I also gained experience with design principles like typography, color, layout and responsive design. Overall it was a valuable learning experience.
